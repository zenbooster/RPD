* Name:        lz.c
* Author:      Marcus Geelnard
* Description: LZ77 coder/decoder implementation.
* Reentrant:   Yes
* $Id: lz.c,v 1.4 2004/10/08 19:28:04 marcus256 Exp $
*
* The LZ77 compression scheme is a substitutional compression scheme
* proposed by Abraham Lempel and Jakob Ziv in 1977. It is very simple in
* its design, and uses no fancy bit level compression.
*
* This is my first attempt at an implementation of a LZ77 code/decoder.
*
* The principle of the LZ77 compression algorithm is to store repeated
* occurrences of strings as references to previous occurrences of the same
* string. The point is that the reference consumes less space than the
* string itself, provided that the string is long enough (in this
* implementation, the string has to be at least 4 bytes long, since the
* minimum coded reference is 3 bytes long). Also note that the term
* "string" refers to any kind of byte sequence (it does not have to be
* an ASCII string, for instance).
*
* The coder uses a brute force approach to finding string matches in the
* history buffer (or "sliding window", if you wish), which is very, very
* slow. I recon the complexity is somewhere between O(n^2) and O(n^3),
* depending on the input data.
*
* There is also a faster implementation that uses a large working buffer
* in which a "jump table" is stored, which is used to quickly find
* possible string matches (see the source code for LZ_CompressFast() for
* more information). The faster method is an order of magnitude faster,
* and also does a full string search in the entire input buffer (it does
* not use a sliding window).
*
* The upside is that decompression is very fast, and the compression ratio
* is often very good.
*
* The reference to a string is coded as a (length,offset) pair, where the
* length indicates the length of the string, and the offset gives the
* offset from the current data position. To distinguish between string
* references and literal strings (uncompressed bytes), a string reference
* is preceded by a marker byte, which is chosen as the least common byte
* symbol in the input data stream (this marker byte is stored in the
* output stream as the first byte).
*
* Occurrences of the marker byte in the stream are encoded as the marker
* byte followed by a zero byte, which means that occurrences of the marker
* byte have to be coded with two bytes.
*
* The lengths and offsets are coded in a variable length fashion, allowing
* values of any magnitude (up to 4294967295 in this implementation).
*
* With this compression scheme, the worst case compression result is
* (257/256)*insize + 1.
